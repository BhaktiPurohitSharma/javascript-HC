// JavaScript has the following kinds of scopes:
// Global scope: The default scope for all code running in script mode.
// Module scope: The scope for code running in module mode.
// Function scope: The scope created with a function.

// In addition, variables declared with let or const can belong to an additional scope:
// Block scope: The scope created with a pair of curly braces (a block).

// A function creates a scope, 
//so that (for example) a variable defined exclusively within the function
// cannot be accessed from outside the function or within other functions.
